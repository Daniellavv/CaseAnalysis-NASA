# CaseAnalysis - NASA
In this Case analysis, I am going to assess why the NASA officials failed taking into account the recommendations provided by the Engineers, and provide an alternative visualization compelling my case.

On January 28, 1986, NASA had planned to launch Challenger, a space shuttle. However, the rocket engineers were hesitant of proceeding with the launch due to the low temperatures that were expected that day. The engineers were concerned that the low temperatures might affect the proper functioning of the rubber O-rings, causing a failure I the fuel booster joint segments. In this way, they presented a series of Exhibits to the NASA officials, based on a detailed analysis of 24 previous shuttle launches, focusing on the temperature and performance of the O-rings. Nevertheless, despite the information provided to the NASA officials, the launch took place, and the space shuttle exploded in less than 90 seconds after liftoff.
